# Data219_0-Gang_Final
This is team 0% Gang's final submission for the UMW Data219 class. The three files are each of the three sections for the project. Notably, none of the source files are stored in this repository.
Instead, they are stored seperately at https://github.com/GalaxyTab7/Data219FinalProject. Also, you may need to click "Open in Colab" to see the plots. Finally, the files are authored to be read in the below order:

-Data219-Intro

-Data219-Analysis

-Data219-ML

Thanks for taking the time to read! 

-Garrett Mckenzie and Marina Davies
